		<h1>Ideas</h1>
		
		<p>I think keeping your ideas "secret" is a mistake. There is an unrealistic fear that someone will see your idea and steal it. The opposite can happen: people will see your ideas and they might offer help, they might know someone working on something similar to colaborate with. At the least, people might just ask about it or give you a nudge to keep going. Here are some ideas for side projects I am working on. Although these are numbered, there really is no order of importance, and I have so many more than I've listed here.</p>

		<p class="sub yellow">1 Bring back finger and make it more useful for the 21st century.</p>
		<p>You probably know about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_protocol">Finger</a>. It's sorf of the OG microblogging service, and I feel like it should make a comeback. I first started digging into this idea after I <a href="https://garbagecollected.org/2017/10/24/the-carmack-plan/">read</a> about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack">John Carmack</a> and his <a href="https://github.com/ESWAT/john-carmack-plan-archive">daily work log.</a> I think there is some value in people being able to see what you are crunching on, and if nothing else, giving yourself a place to see your progress, make some notes, share a story, etc. I am attracted to the lo-fi nature of this idea. I don't want hashtags and trending topics. I started hacking on it <a href="http://planfile.xyz">here</a>. (It's buggy)</p>
		
		<p class="sub blue">2 Kill LinkedIn for blue-collar workers. <br /><br /></p>
		<p>LinkedIn is fine. But that's it. It's just fine. I think it is pretty targeted at a specific sort of worker - the traditional white-collar worker. I have a lot of family and friends who work in blue-collar industries, and what is happening on LinkedIn sort of leaves them behind. I think there is a real opportunity to build a LinkedIn targeted at this audeience. Hey, I already bought the <a href="http://bluecollars.ca">domain name</a>, that's step 1, right?</p>
		
		<p class="sub green">3 Help restaurants and people communicate with eachother about specials they are interested in.</p>
		<p>This is probably one of my oldest ideas, which makes it my most embarrasing. I first had this idea back in the early 2000's when everyone was making "mashups" and public APIs were popping up everywhere. The idea is simple: an app where I can see the 'specials' that are near me right now. I am actively working on this idea, I think there is something here, especially given the <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/stellas-cafe-skip-the-dishes-1.4765317">rates that a lot of the online ordering apps are charging restaurants</a>. That's not sustainable. <a href="https://lunchhunt.com">Lunchhunt.com</a> is the answer.</p>
		
		
		<p class="sub red">4 Help distributed workplaces co-ordinate and easily adhere to a corporate mandate.</p>
		<p>Since a lot of us are working durring the day, we put in time on your projects at nights and on weekends. Who doesn't like requesting work on a Friday afternoon and getting results by Monday morning? You won't find an agency who can do that week in and week out.</p>
		
		<p class="sub purple">5 Live the childhood dream of making a video game.<br /><br /></p>
		<p>There isn't a single area of the business we haven't touched. We know someone who can sub-contract just about any work you need done. From annual report design to interactive flash games to video production, we know who you are looking for. </p>
